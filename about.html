<h2>This is a fan page of great K-pop Princess Boy band called as SHINEe</h2>
<p>
Shinee bagged all the rookie awards in 2008, were once compared to The Beatles and were the first K-pop group to play a concert in London
Taemin, Minho, Onew and Key stayed together after the sudden death of member Jonghyun, and are also known for their colourful fashion sense.
With Key dropping a teaser for his new solo album, Minho soon to appear in a highly anticipated new K-drama, and photos of Taemin’s military service going viral on the internet, Shinee clearly continues to capture fans’ attention across the globe after over a decade in the industry.
It has been 13 years since their debut, but the group continues to stay relevant, thanks in no small part to their peppy music and flashy personal styles. The group’s latest album “Don’t Call Me”, released earlier this year, even peaked at No 1 on iTunes in 46 countries – a true testament that the group is still going strong.
With other Korean groups struggling to last half as long, Shinee lords it over them all as the “Princes of K-pop”.
Here’s how they’ve managed to stay legends.
Shinee started off as something of an experiment for SM Entertainment, and the company didn’t expect much out of them, according to KpopStarz. But the members’ developing talent in vocals and dance earned them their reputation.
When the group debuted in 2008, it was pegged as a contemporary R&B act and, while they’ve certainly won that genre, they’ve proven themselves to be versatile by branching into several others besides.
The group demonstrated its versatility with songs like Everybody (which dabbled in dubstep), Dream Girl (an electro-funk hit), Why So Serious (which had a touch of hard rock to it), as well as several melodic ballads.
But they went a step further when they released View in 2015 – the first K-pop song to ever stray into deep house. According to Billboard, the album led the group to its second No 1 spot on the World Album Charts, while the single debuted at No 2.
Then, this year, Shinee released its first-ever hip-hop track, Don’t Call Me, which proved to be as popular as all the others – and showed that the group could evolve with the times as well as anyone.
KpopStarz also highlighted the fact that the group didn’t do any official promotion or teasers for its debut song Replay in 2008, yet remarkably went on to bag all the rookie awards that year. Within a matter of months, Shinee’s complex choreography and upbeat music became instantly recognisable.
In the years that followed, Shinee became the first K-pop group to hold a solo concert for the general public in London – at the London Korean Film Festival in 2011, according to The Korean Herald – while Allkpop reported that the then-CEO of Abbey Road Studios, made famous by The Beatles, had even compared the group to the legendary British band.
And when Shinee collected its award for the single Juliette, written by late member Jonghyun, that seemed to pave the way for future Korean artists to be more active in creating and writing their own music.
And it wasn’t just musical barriers that the group broke. While the second generation of K-pop boy bands were known for their manly appearances and “boyfriend material” vibes, Shinee broke with tradition by adopting a more feminine appearance. Minho and Taemin both went for long hairstyles paired with eye-catching clothes. Perhaps most notably, Taemin got hair extensions for Sherlock while he kept his original long hair for Lucifer.
